The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!


Example:

```c
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

## 题目大意

从 x 轴开始，给出一个数组，数组里面的数字代表从 (0,0) 点开始，宽度为 1 个单位，高度为数组元素的值。如果下雨了，问这样一个容器能装多少单位的水？
